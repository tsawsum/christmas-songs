Well you've all heard the story
About Rudolph and his nose
Well I'll tell you a Christmas Tale
That never has been told
Well you may think you've heard it all
But you ain't heard nothin' yet
About that crazy Christmas
That the North Pole can't forget

Rudolph was under the weather
And had to call in sick
So he got on the horn
To his cousin Leroy
Who lived out in the sticks
He said Santa's really counting on me
And I hate to pass the buck
Leroy said Hey I'm on my way
And he jumped in his pick-up truck
When Leroy got to the North Pole
All the reindeer snickered and laughed
They never seen a deer in overalls
And a John Deer trucker hat
Well Santa stepped in
And said just calm down
Cuz we all got a job to do
Like it or not Leroy's in charge
And he's gonna be leading you
And it was

Leroy The Redneck Reindeer
Hooked to the front of the sleigh
Delivering toys to all the good ol' boys
And girls along the way
He's just a down home party animal
Two Steppin all across the sky
He mixes jingle bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night

Before that night was over
Leroy had changed their tune
He had them scootin a hoof
On every single roof
By the light of a neon moon
Santa wrapped his bag with the dixie flag
He was having the time of his life
You could hear him call
Merry Chistmas Ya'll
And to all of ya'll a goodnight
And it was

Leroy The Redneck Reindeer
Hooked to the front of the sleigh
Delivering toys to all the good ol' boys
And girls along the way
He's just a down home party animal
Two Steppin all across the sky
He mixes jingle bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night

He mixes Jingle Bells with the rebel yell
And made history that night
