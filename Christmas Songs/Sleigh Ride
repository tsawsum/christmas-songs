Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring ting ting-a-ting too
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling you hoo
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We snuggle close together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Grey
It'll be the perfect ending
Of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing
Without a single stop
At the fireplace where
We'll watch the chestnuts pop
Pop pop pop

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in this world can buy
When they pass around
The coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like
A picture print by Currier & lives
These wonderful things
Are the things
We remember all through our lives
These wonderful things
Are the things
We remember all through our lives

Sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring ting ting-a-ting too
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling you hoo
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintery fairyland

Nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We snuggle close together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

It's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
