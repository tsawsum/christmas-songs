Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

Gloria, Gloria, Gloria,
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria,
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria,
...
Angels we have heard on high
...
Come and see...Gloria
