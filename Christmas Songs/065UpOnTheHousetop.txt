
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes, here he comes

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes, here he comes

Up on the housetop, reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for everyone's Christmas joys

Tito had just one desire
That he gets a new guitar
But he wants a guarantee
That it won't play out of key

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick

(I said) Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes, here he comes

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes, here he comes

Jackie's almost six feet tall
But no hot shot at basketball
Bring him a basket three feet tall
Maybe he'll play like a pro

Marlon wears his shoes so thin
He's gone through his socks again
He's always dancin' as you know
(So bring me some shoes with lots of sole)

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick

(I said) Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick

Patter patter pitter patter
Pitter patter patter
Pitter patter pitter patter
Pitter patter patter

Oh Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and Vixen
Come on Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blixen
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away, dash away all!

Did you read Santa Claus my list?
All the girls you're waiting to kiss?
Mike, that list was only a joke
Too late, Jermaine, he's bringing you mistletoe

But you just want toys and stuff
Yeah, but that's not even half enough
What I want means more than fun
What's that? - Love and peace for everyone

Up on the house top reindeer stand
Waiting for that dear old man
Up to the chimney with gifts to spare
And lots of Christmas joy to share

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Up out through the chimney with old St. Nick

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Up through the chimney with old St. Nick

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Up through the chimney with old St. Nick

Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn t go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click,
Up through the chimney with old St. Nick
