We three kings of orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Oh Star of wonder star of night
Star of royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Born a king on bethlehems plain
Gold I bring to crown him again
King forever ceasing
Never over us all to reign

Oh Star of wonder star of night
Star of royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light Hmmm Hmmmm
Allelujah allelujah allelujah

Oh oh Star of wonder star of night
Star of royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Guide us to thy perfect light
Guide us to thy perfect light hmmmmmm
