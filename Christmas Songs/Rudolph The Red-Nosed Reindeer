Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose (a shiny nose)
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows. (it glows)

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names. (they call him names)
They never let poor rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.

Then one foggy christmas eve, santa came to say,
"rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Then how the reindeers loved him,
And they shouted out with glee (they shout with glee)
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history.

"then how the reindeers loved him,
They really, really loved him.
They used to say, rudolph, we love you!!
And rudolph would say"

Then one foggy christmas eve, santa came to say,
He said, "santa,
No he didn't, he said, "rudolph, ha, ha, ha, won't (won't) you guide (guide) my sleigh tonight?"

Well, then how the reindeer loved him, (they really, really loved him)
And they shouted out with glee (they shout with glee)
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history.

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer,
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer,
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer,
Ringo, the red-nosed reindeer, (ringo)
You'll go down in history.
