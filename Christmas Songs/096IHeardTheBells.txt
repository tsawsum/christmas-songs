I heard the bells on christmas day their old familiar carols play, and wild and
Sweet the words repeat of peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how, as the day had come, the belfries of all christendom had rolled
Along th'un broken song of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head; "there is no peace on earth," I said, "for hate
Is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth, good will to men."

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep; "god is not dead, nor doth he sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, with peace on earth, good will to men."

Till, ringing singing on it's way, the world revolved from night to day. a
Voice, a chime, a chant sublime, of peace on earth, good will to men.
