Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
This Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Let's go

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer
And you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town,
They do
This Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Shake a hand
Shake a hand now

The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
So special for you and me
Yes, it will be

Shake a hand now, come on
Everybody shake a hand now, family
We'll be together to make this Christmas right
Yes, we will
