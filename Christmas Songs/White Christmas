I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glistenAnd children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snowI'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be whiteI'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know, (uh, uh, uh)
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen to hear
Sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright...
And may all your Christmases be white...
