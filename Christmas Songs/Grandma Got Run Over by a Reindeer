Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe

She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog
And we'd begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication
And she staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas mornin'
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe)

Now we're all so proud of Grandpa
He's been takin' this so well
See him in there watchin' football
Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
(Lord, we believe)

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And a blue and silver candle
That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig
I've warned all my friends and neighbors
"Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves."

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa's
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe

Sing it, Grandpa!
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve
(Minding her own business)
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
(What do you mean there's no Santa?)
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
Sing it, Grandpa!

Oh
As for me and Grandpa, we believe
(We believe in Santa Claus)
