The Angel Gabriel from heaven came
His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame
"All hail" said he thou lowly Maiden Mary
Most highly favoured lady Gloria, Glor...

For known a blessed mother thou shalt be
All generations laud and honor thee
Thy son shall be Emmanuel by seers foretold
Most highly favoured lady Gloria, Glor...

Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head
"To me, be as it pleaseth God" she said
"My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name"
Most highly favoured lady Gloria, Glor...
