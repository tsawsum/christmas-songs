
While shepherds kept their watchin'
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light, yeah

Oh I said
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Our Jesus Christ is born

The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo! Above the Earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Savior's birth

Oh I said
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Our Jesus Christ is born

When I was a lonly seeker
I sought both night and day
I asked the Lord to help me
And he showed me the way

He made me a watchman
Upon a city wall
And if I am a Christian
I am the least of all

So I said
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Our Jesus Christ is born

Go tell them
Go tell them
Go tell them
Go tell them
Go tell them
Go tell them
Go tell them
Go tell them
