Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm tryna play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
It's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
Or if it's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
On the 25th by the fireplace, oh-oh-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart

Oh, baby
(Santa tell me)
If ya won't be
(Santa tell me)
If ya won't be here!
(Santa tell me)

Santa, tell me if you're really there (Santa tell me)
(If you're really there)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year (He won't be here next year)
Santa, tell me if he really cares (Tell me)
(Tell me babe)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year (He won't be here next year)

Santa, tell me if you're really there (Tell me)
(Tell me baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me if he really cares (Tell me)
(Do you care)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here (He won't be here next year)
Next year
