I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Christmas is all around me
And so the feeling grows

It's written in the wind
It's everywhere I go
So if you really love Christmas
Come on and let it snow

You know I love Christmas
I always will
My mind's made up
The way that I feel

There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on Christmas
You can depend

You gave your presents to me
And I gave mine to you
I need Santa beside me
In everything I do

You know I love Christmas
I always will
My mind's made up
The way that I feel

There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on Christmas
You can depend

'Cause on Christmas
You can depend

It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show

So if you really love
Come on and let it
If you really love me
Come on and let it

Now if you really love me
Come on and let it show
