Call on your Angels, come down to the city
Crowd around the big tree, all you strangers who know me
Bring your compassion, your understanding
Lord, how we need it on this New York City Christmas

Yeah, I'm sending you a Merry New York Christmas
And a prayer for peace on earth within our time
Hear the sidewalk Angels echo, "Halleluja"
We understand them, now more than ever

So call on your angels, you're beaten and broken
It's time that we mended so they don't fade with the season
Let our mercy be the gifts we lay from Brooklyn to Broadway
And celebrate each and every day of this New York City Christmas

Yeah, I'm sending you a Merry New York Christmas
And a prayer for peace on earth within our time
Hear the sidewalk angels echo, "Halleluja"
We understand them, now more than ever
Merry New York Christmas

Call on your Angels, come down to the city
Let's crowd around the big tree, all you strangers you know me
Bring your compassion, bring your forgiveness
Lord, how we need it on this New York City Christmas

Yeah, I'm sending you a Merry New York Christmas
And a prayer for peace on earth, it's not too late
Yeah, the sidewalk Angels echo, "Hallelujah"
We understand them, we hear them say
Merry Christmas, ah yeah, yes, a New York City Christmas

Merry New York Christmas
